# Vehile Registration Number Availability Checker
This Node JS script is used to get the availability of Vehicle Registration Numbers from India's Parivahan site. The script is provided for informational purposes only. I am not responsible for any legal trouble that you may encounter as a result of using this script.

## Usage

To use the script, you will need to install Puppeteer and Node.js. Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can run the script with the following command:

```bash
npm i
node index.js
```

The script will output a CSV file containing the vehicle registration data.
It caches the collected details in the `data.json` file.
